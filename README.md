Who killed Ms. Gladis? A question that became after we found out that Gladis was dead at her millionaire big house.
If you know the board game Clue, it will be easy to know what is our game about. You have to found out who was the killer, what tool did they use and where happened.

Our play is designed to play it with only one device (PC/Laptop).

The logic and all coding was made in the C language, using different tools like conditionals, structs, loops, also using the Raylib library to design all the interface.
If you wanna know more about the development of the game, you can check our code which is commented and encapsulated to be easily read.

This project was made for our Structured Programming class by Luis Acosta and Carolina Arellano.
Hope you like it!!
